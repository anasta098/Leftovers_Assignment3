		<p>Christian is shopping for some furniture to redecorate his room.   
		He prefers to use his phone when it comes to shopping as  
		it is easier to navigate through catalogues on his phone. 
		Christian tends to get confused when he shops on a webpage  
		instead of an app as webpages tend to have many functions   
		and pages. Christian stumbles upon FlippingRooms 
		and realises this app come with a build in catalogue feature.  
		The catalogue feature allows him to browse through a huge variety 
		of furniture at ease
