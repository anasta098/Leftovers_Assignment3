	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Redecorating a room may be a daunting experience for some people. Some people might find it hard to visualise how a room is going to look like when they purchase a new television set or a new L-shape couch. Furniture in general is also not cheap. FlippingRooms does not want the user to make a decision to purchase something that will create a hole in their wallets and potentially regretting it later on in the future. Well, FlippingRooms can be a solution to all of those problems.â€¯ </p>
	<p>FlippingRooms provides a catalogue of pre-installed furniture in the application. Users are allowed to experiment with different kinds of furniture to enhance the new look of their room and to make sure they are liking the final design before making any final decisions. </p>
	<div class="text">
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th style="width:50%	;">
		<p>Christian is shopping for some furniture to redecorate his room.   
		He prefers to use his phone when it comes to shopping as  
		it is easier to navigate through catalogues on his phone. 
		Christian tends to get confused when he shops on a webpage  
		instead of an app as webpages tend to have many functions   
		and pages. Christian stumbles upon FlippingRooms 
		and realises this app come with a build in catalogue feature.  
		The catalogue feature allows him to browse through a huge variety 
		of furniture at ease
