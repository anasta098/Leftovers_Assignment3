	<p><b>Interest and Skills</b></p>
	<p>My interest is in design and. I enjoy making things effective and easy to use while also making them look aesthetically pleasing. I have a good attention to detail and am good at seeing things from different perspectives. I am also very creative and have good social skills so communicating ideas is something I like doing. </p>
	<p><b>Individually assigned roles</b></p>
	<p>My job was front-end developer, so I worked on making things work for the users while also making it look pleasing. I worked on the websites for our previous assignments so to develop my programming skills and design skills I've been working on. I think this has helped me learn new skills as it allows me to understand the processes of development and design and helped me make things as part of a group. </p>
