<p>It is crucial that our team needed to have great team management, a good communication system and an easy shareable document editor program in place especially during this troubled time. The tools that we used to ensure everyone was always up to date with their workloads were: </p>
<p><b>Trello Board</b><br><a href="https://trello.com/b/7ZhbRRft/flippingrooms">https://trello.com/b/7ZhbRRft/flippingrooms </a> <br>A digital Kanban board which allows each member to identify the task that is required to be completed, allowed tasks to be allocated to each specific team member and provides reminders for due dates to tasks and milestones. </p>
<p><b>MS Teams</b><br><a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a9c776f5f5df143309ba63c3ca78169e8%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=18ca0ee5-2c19-4606-8fe7-b052b4639d66&tenantId=d1323671-cdbe-4417-b4d4-bdb24b51316b">https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a9c776f5f5df143309ba63c3ca78169e8%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=18ca0ee5-2c19-4606-8fe7-b052b4639d66&tenantId=d1323671-cdbe-4417-b4d4-bdb24b51316b</a> <br>A platform for members to communicate with one another. MS Teams was used to schedule our weekly meetings and discuss our progress throughout the project. MS Teams allowed us to record all meetings and the chat service ensured all communication would be seen by every team member </p>
<p><b>Google Docs</b><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16h25tau7XUIl67IOoWyxNZfBnwyRXSL3UW9r8sSgcZg/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/16h25tau7XUIl67IOoWyxNZfBnwyRXSL3UW9r8sSgcZg/edit</a> <br>Our shared drive folder allowed files to be shared amongst everyone. Google docs enabled the group to work on the documentation simultaneously with control if any issues were to occur. </p>
<p><b>Google Sheets</b><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ERH7X9u9go2l43L28U6wl1WAb8rPTw0hUJOoA8gmgvs/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ERH7X9u9go2l43L28U6wl1WAb8rPTw0hUJOoA8gmgvs/edit#gid=0 </a></p>
<p><b>GitHub</b><br><a href="https://github.com/anasta098/Leftovers_Assignment1_PartA">Assignment 1 Github</a> <br><a href="https://github.com/anasta098/Leftovers_Assignment2">Assignment 2 Github</a> <br><a href="https://github.com/anasta098/Leftovers_Assignment3">Assignment 3 Github</a>
<br>A platform to upload all the coding that was involved in the project. Github allowed all team members to upload their code and work with other team members simultaneously. </p>
<p><b>AWS Bucket</b><br><a href="http://leftoverswebsite.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/">Assignment 1</a> <br><a href="http://leftover.assignment2.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/homepage.html">Assignment 2</a> <br>
A platform we used to showcase our project</p>

<p><b>Design</b></p>
<p>As a group, we were passionate about the design of our app. This allowed us to capture our ideas and create the app. The tools that we used were: </p> 
<p><b>Pen and paper</b><br>Initial ideas and design were drawn on a piece of paper before converting them into a visual representation. </p>
<p><b>Figma</b><br>Figma is a collaborative tool we used when it came to create the prototypes. Figma allowed the team to create the visual representation of our design for the app with build-in frames and tools. This allowed the team to have a visual on how the app would work before app development begins </p>
<p><b>Lucid Chart</b><br> A platform that was used to create the System Context Diagrams. LucidChart allowed the team to further breakdown how a user would interact with our app. </p>

<p><b>App Development</b></p>
<p>There were many elements incorporated with the development of our software. Our project requires visual studio code for website construction, MySQL for storing data, GitHub for sharing and storing code (the above are all open source software).</p>
<p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used to create user-oriented web pages. The square bracket editor version 1.41.2 perfectly installs the above three languages and is simple to operate. These tools would allow us to cut the project budget. The last GitHub (website) will serve as a tool for us to work with each other. GitHub has the characteristics of open source, free, stable, etc. The most important thing is that we can use GitHub skilfully through the previous assignment experience.  </p>
