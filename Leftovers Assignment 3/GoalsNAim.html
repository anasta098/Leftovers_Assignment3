<p><b>Aim</b></p>
<p>The aim of the project was to create a simple but helpful mobile app that would allow our users to remodel their open spaces without the hassle of moving the physical furniture around. It would give the user a creative outlet to redecorate their lovely homes or office spaces into the desired look of their choice virtually before making it into reality. FlippingRooms would provide a user-friendly app that allows the user to customise a particular room and remodel it with the Building Tools Feature. The user is also able to use the Camera Feature to scan the room before it appears on their screens in a 2D format and the user is able to remove and add any desired furniture with the tools incorporated into the app. In addition to that, FlippingRooms offers the user a Catalogue feature to browse through the different types of furniture to enhance the room that is being remodelled. Once the user is satisfied with how the room looks, the user is able to save their projects by creating account with our app using the Account Creation Feature and add the furniture into a list with the To Buy List feature. FlippingRooms aims to be built as a cross platform application for both iOS and Android users so we could reach a larger clientele in the market.</p>
<p><b>Goals</b></p>
<p>In order to achieve the aim of our project, we have set some goals stated below. </p>
<p><b>Camera Feature:</b> The goal of this feature is to allow the user to have option to scan the entire room with their camera without having to lay out the entire room manually. This gives the user a hassle free of beginning the remodelling phase. In addition, the room that is being scanned will be up to scale when it appears on the screen of the user. If the user is unable to fully scan the room, the user is given the option to manually change the dimensions and layout of the room. </p>
<p><b>Catalogue Feature:</b> The goal is to give the user some inspiration on how different types of furniture would suit their style. The user is given a plethora of furniture to choose from and is able to experiment with a new look they want to achieve. The user is able to drag and drop the selected furniture on their screen and create the desired outcome. Moreover, this allows the user to have a glimpse of how the room looks like before purchasing the furniture to remodel the room. This saves the user the hassle of deciding on the spot and potentially spending money on something that they might regret in the future. </p>
<p><b>Building Tools Feature:</b> This is our most important feature for the project. The goal of this feature is to give the user the option to remodel the home with different building tools like adding partitions to a room, adding different types of flooring, adding different types of lighting and changing the paint on the wall or deciding on a new wallpaper. This allows the user to fully visualise the complete look of the room before making a final decision. We aim to take that daunting experience away from our users with the Building Tools Feature. </p>
<p><b>Account Management:</b> The goal of our account creation feature is for the user to create a bond with us. If the user is satisfied with our mobile app, the user is able to sign up with an account with us. On top of that, the user is able to save the projects that they have started and share it with their peers on multiple devices. This would benefit our users like Interior Designers as they are able to show their creations to potential clients with a simple click of a button on our app</p>
