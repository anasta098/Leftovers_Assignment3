	<p><b>Interest and Skills</b></p>
	<p>I wanted to be a hacker when I was a kid because I thought it was interesting, but I had never been exposed to any knowledge related to IT before I was accepted into RMIT. Now that I have been exposed to some IT knowledge, I know it is too difficult to be a hacker. Maybe that kind of computer genius only appears in movies. However, I didn't want to give up. When I came to RMIT, I made my goal clearer. I wanted to develop towards network security. If I can't hack into someone else's system anytime, anywhere, I am determined to create a system that can't be hacked. </p>
	<p><b>Individually assigned roles</b></p>
	<p>I was assigned to be a full stack developer. I enjoyed leading the team on the development of the project and I also enjoyed the work of programming. Being a developer requires strong skills in multiple areas and adaptability when dealing with new tasks. A good developer can assign the team as needed to make sure the work gets done on time. </p>
