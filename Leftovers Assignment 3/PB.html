	<p> Coming up with an idea which would challenge us was something our group as a whole agreed on. This would give us a greater understanding on how to build IT systems from scratch and the processes behind it as well. Before beginning the project, we discussed our strengths and weaknesses and what we would be bringing to the table. While most of us excel on creating the concept for the app, many of us share the same weakness of being inexperienced with programming. As a group, we decided on the idea of FlippingRooms as it would give us the opportunity to develop new skills and knowledge such as creating an AR environment, programming and UX design. In addition to that, we are able to build our repertoire in app development in which we can put to good use in our future endeavours. </p>
	<p>FlippingRooms is an application designed to help the user with the processes of remodelling and redecorating a specific room without the hassle of moving the furniture around physically. FlippingRooms uses AR to help design the room and AR is an aspect that every team member is interested in. This would allow each member to brush up on their skills in 3D modelling and designing an app that is user friendly. These skills that would be incorporated into every member can be taken into the workforce and allows each member a taste of how the real world looks like. Moreover, this gives everyone an equal opportunity to deep their toes into the water and allows us to know if this is in the industry in IT that we want to further our skills in. </p>
	<p>Furthermore, each team member set a target for themselves and wanted to create something that was useful and helpful. We wanted to create an app that would help others achieve their ideal look for their homes. We wanted to create an app that would simplify a task that is deemed complicated for others and make their lives easier. Interior designing can be hard to grasp for some and with FlippingRooms, the task of designing can be portrayed simpler in an accurate and in a timely manner. FlippingRooms allows the user to make quick changes to a room with simple functions and the user is able to know what the room would potentially look like immediately. This app idea has the potential because of the broad user group and would potentially help many immensely as it allows the user to visualise the design of the room with AR. The user groups we are trying to focus on would be Interior Designers and individuals who own their own home or who just purchased a home. </p>
