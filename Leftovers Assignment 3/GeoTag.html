	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Besides being connected to various professionals in the industry, users are given the choice to enable their geolocation services. Users who enable this function will be able to connect themselves with furniture stores around the vicinity and compare prices based on their own personal budgets. 
To ensure their privacy is being taken care of, this information is strictly confidential and between the user and FlippingRooms. Once the user is satisfied with their findings, the user is able to turn off their locations at any point of time. </p>
