<p>Benjamin Phan's contributions and input for this project was minimal and subpar at best. In addition, his role on this project barely met the satisfactory requirement for the assigned parts leading to a cascading delay in the timeline fitted for the project. Due to negligence on his individual part, the rest of the team had to compensate for his lack of commitment, attention and  significant absence in effort, resulting in compounded workload to meet the specified deadlines. In light of his absence, the team has tried to get in touch with Benjamin through multiple communication channels (i.e. MS Teams and email). However, the approach was not taken kindly and was met with hostilities on reply. His response to our email was rudely uncalled for, where he vented out (specifically to our group leader Ting Xian Sean, Wong). When the rest of the team intervened in an attempt to calm him down and understand his viewpoints, he deleted all his unruly messages on MS Teams. Benjaminâ€™s attitude and lack of effort in this group project is not only irresponsible, it should be noted for future references and reflected in this platform to the assessment team.                                                                          </p>
