	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>FlippingRooms allows the user to immerse themselves in an augmented reality (AR) when it comes to remodelling and redesigning their own rooms. With the camera feature installed in the application, the user is able to take a photo of the size of the room that they are planning to redecorate. In addition to that, if the camera is unable to capture every angle of the room, the user has the alternative to resize the room manually. The user has the choice to set the room to scale for easier manoeuvring when it comes to picking the right couch or right bedside table. </p>
	<p>After decorating the room to the preferred choice of the user, the user is able to view the room from different perspectives. When the user is using the camera feature in FlippingRooms, the user can view the room from the side and top angle to ensure that this is the ideal final look for the specific room being remodelled. The user is allowed to look at a before and after layout as well. </p>
