	<h2>What have you learned about group projects? What has worked well in your group? What hasn't worked well? </h2>
	<p>Working as a group for the last 12 weeks, some of the things that we have learned about group projects are: </p>
	<p><b>Organisation:</b> At the beginning of each assignment, we would have a meeting to discuss the responsibilities and roles of each person. It was very important to assign roles, which made each of us realise that we were part of the whole team and could not be separated from each other. It not only improved the cohesion of the team, but also made us work like a professional team.</p>
	<p><b>Time management:</b> We learned how to manage our time as a group as every member has their own personal responsibilities workload from other courses. We scheduled a weekly meeting in order for everyone to be updated on the task that has been completed and the issues faced during that week. This was prominent during the last few weeks of the project as many other courses had due dates aligned one after the other. </p>
	<p><b>Team Communication:</b> As a member of a team, you must make sure that your ideas and voice are heard by others. It is important that we discuss and propose solutions to the problems we may encounter before starting the project, as well as be clear about our goals and aims for this project. It is paramount that we all have a method of communication outside of the classroom to ensure any issues could be resolved promptly. </p>

	
	<h2>What use did you make of your Mentor? What use did you make of your Lecturer in guiding you?  </h2>
	<p>Our mentor and lecturer have helped us throughout the entire process of this project. We would schedule a weekly meeting every Wednesday on MS Teams to keep everyone up to date of the progress of this project. Our mentor would give us feedback on what is working and gave us suggestions on the issue we were facing. He was very helpful and patient with every single query we had. Our lecturer on the other hand had meetings with us to stay on track with the milestones we have accomplished.  </p>
	
	<h2>What were the group processes for communication? How effective were they? Have there been any changes since the start of the semester? </h2>
	<p>Throughout the entire project, we have used MS Teams to communicate with one another. It has been very effective as we are able to record the meetings and store them on MS Teams for all members to review. It has worked very well for our weekly meetings with our mentor and our own personal meetings as well.  </p>
	
	<h2>From your experience in this project, what is the most important aspect of organising a project of this nature? Is there anything that you would do differently if you were to start again? </h2>
	<p>From our experience in this project,â€¯ the most important aspect is to make sure that we can meet the deadline. We should try to finish our respective tasks and integrate them before the deadline so that we can have time to modify and polish our project. On the other hand, based on this experience we would try Agile Ways in the next project so that we can get things done better and more efficiently. </p>
	
	<h2>What advice would you give to a group about to embark on a similar project? </h2>
	<p>With all the help that we have received from each member, tutor and lecturer, we would suggest planning and coordinate the task assigned efficiently and effectively. Every group should ensure they leave enough room for error and have enough time to accomplish the goals set for the project. Every group should use tools such as Trello to keep each member in the loop on all task to ensure nothing slips out of the cracks during crucial deadlines. As mentioned above, adopting Agile Ways method could be beneficial as it allows the team to accomplish tasks in a quicker way. This in return would reduce last minute stress and increase the general quality of work. </p>
