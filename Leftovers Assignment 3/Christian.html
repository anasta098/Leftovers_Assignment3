	<p><b>Interest and Skills</b></p>
	<p>My greatest interest lies in Cyber Security as I believe it is of utmost importance in this day and age. As I currently work in a bank, I have encountered individuals who have fallen victim to cyber-attacks and scams, which has only further emphasized security's importance and grown my interest. </p>
	<p><b>Individually assigned roles</b></p>
	<p>I was initially assigned the role of a back-end developer however due to family commitments and complications throughout the latter half of the semester, I was unable to fulfill my obligations. Throughout the final assignment, I contributed marginally and contributed less than I had been assigned, with other team members covering for me</p>
