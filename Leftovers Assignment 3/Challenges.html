<h2>What have we found easy </h2>
<p>The design phase was the easiest for all team members involved as one of our members have experience in designing. Designing the prototypes on Figma was not challenging as there are clear steps on how to add each feature and how to link the pages when it is done.  </p>

<h2>What have we found difficult </h2>
<p>Some of the challenges that we faced during this project is learning how to code the app. This is due to the lack of knowledge on app development that each member faced. On top of that, time management was another issue we found difficult in the early stages. This is due to the heavy workload we had from other courses and the conflicting timetables from each member. It was a struggle to find the right time for every member to be able to attend the meetings thus, struggling to complete the tasks of completing the features for this app </p>

<h2>What was unexpected </h2>
<p>We did not expect that some of the team members were not as reliant when it came to completing the task that was assigned to them. Due to that, other team members had to pick up the slack on the work that was not done thus, delaying the timeframe that we have set on completing this project </p>

<h2>What challenges were we expecting </h2>
<p>We expected that this project was going to be a challenge to each individual. However, as we pass each milestone for this project, we as a team manage to overcome the challenge and finishing certain task on time. Every member learned how to manage their time better as well as learn to work in a group with even distribution of work </p>

<h2>What have we done to address these challenges </h2>
<p>We agreed as a team to voice out any complications faced when trying to complete a task in our weekly meetings. We discussed on other ways to help resolve that issue and not leave it to the last minute to handle. </p>

<h2>New skills and experience we have learned </h2>
<p>One of the new skills that we have learn to use was Figma. Figma was introduced to the group when it came down to designing the prototype for our app. As this was a new platform for most of us, we needed to learn the tricks of using that platform. In addition to that, using the Trello board was a new experience for us as well. In the earlier stages, we struggled on all the features that Trello had to offer but eventually we understood how to use to Trello to keep track of everyone's workload. It was an eventually learning experience for each of us when we could help other members out who were struggling with the task handed to them. </p>
<p>We also learn the fundamentals or team management and time management as a group. Learning how to build an app from scratch was not easy for every member but we manage to work as a team and played to our strengths while working on our own weaknesses. We also learn how to speak to everyone in an open manner and trust one another. Whenever one is struggling in a particular task, that issue would be resolved in our weekly meetings. Furthermore, we learn how to code some of our features required for the app.  </p>

<h2>Things that did not work out </h2>
<p>We planned to build a fully functional app by the end of this project but due to the time constraints and lack of knowledge, we faced some unexpected challenges and was not able to fully achieve our plan. We manage to produce some of the features incorporated for the app, but we could not connect the mobile client to the back-end service to complete the full end to end working prototype. </p>
<p>Moreover, due to lack of resources and experience, we could not work on implementing the iOS mobile client for the application as intended.  </p>

<h2>Plan changes / What would we have changed to the plan </h2>
<p>If we knew about the complications we would face, we would have revised our scope for the project. The initial plan for this project was to create an app that implemented augmented reality (AR) which allows the user to be fully emerged in the app. As the weeks go by, we realised that we would not have enough time to implement that idea and changed our initial scope of an AR app to a two-dimensional (2D) version of it. This way, we would have more time working on the design and have a fully functional end to end mobile app. If we would be able to start again, we would have discussed further on our strengths in order to make this app a reality. </p>

<h2>Realistic timetable </h2>
<p>Looking back at our timetable and taking all the complications we had to face, we agreed that the timetable allocated for each member was not realistic. We would have reduced the workload on our scope to what we could manage and focus on that in order to achieve a workable app. </p>

<h2>Tools and techniques </h2>
<p>Generally, the tools that were used to achieve this project has been working out well for the team. The only main issue that every member had was the knowledge and experience to code for a mobile app. </p>
