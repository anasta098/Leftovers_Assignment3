<p>We first started the project with deciding on the type of application we wanted to build together. Our idea came from one of our team members, Ting Xian Sean Wong when he got the inspiration of remodelling his own home. The topic of a remodelling app was chosen because we found it really interesting and could be useful to us and others. Once the idea was set in stone, we started our process towards planning the minimum and extended viable features our project would have. In addition to that, we identified the goals of the project, the scope with specific features and the aim of this project. </p>
<p>It took us a while to fully realise what features we wanted to include in this project. The biggest challenge faced by all of us is that we have a clear vision of what the project will be but the execution would be a challenge as most of our team members are at a beginner level when it comes to coding. We lacked the knowledge and experience necessary to both figuring out the code and estimating the time required to implement and test the functionality of the app. After a few meetings, we ultimately decided on a list of features to implement on the app as well as some extended features that we would like to implement if time permitted. </p>
<p>A challenge that we faced was some team members were not as active as others. This, together with the other workloads from other courses led us to not having enough time to implement all the features that we have planned for. Additionally, most of our team members lack the capabilities to code as described above. The lack of experience and knowledge led us to many challenges along the way. All of these have made us not able to progress as much as we intended to originally. However, we have learned valuable lessons along the way and hopefully in the future, we might be able to make this app functional. </p>
