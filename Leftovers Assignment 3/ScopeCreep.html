<p>Scope creep is not something we struggle with for this project. This is because we all understand our abilities and have been quite open about our weaknesses. Programming is something that many of us know we would struggle at. Thus, picking an idea which would be possible for us to do and would not be something we thought was too daunting for our skill levels allowed us to explore the idea of a remodelling app.</p>
<p>Scope contraction happened with what exactly our idea was. Originally there was some confusion on what specific features, mainly the Camera Scan feature was intended to be. Once we sorted that out, it became clearer as we understood what we envisioned. Scope is something our group has been good at keeping consistent because we were honest, open, and communicated what we thought we could and could not do. This has helped as it allows us to have a much better vision on the project.</p>
<p>However, we did change one major part of our project, which is the mobile client platforms. Our initial idea was to develop an app that would be available across all platforms, supporting both Android and iOS. Due to the lack of experience, resources and time constraints, we only managed to implement the basic parts of the Android mobile client and had to remove the iOS client from the scope of the project. </p>
