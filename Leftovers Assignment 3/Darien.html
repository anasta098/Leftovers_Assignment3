	<p><b>Interest and Skills</b></p>
	<p>My interest in IT is cybersecurity as I strive to make an application in the future that would be able to protect any technology, I use at home such as my computer as I spend most of my time using my computer. I have good communication skills and socialising skills so working in a group is no stress for me as I am able to do my best when I am in a group.</p>
	<p><b>Individually assigned roles</b></p>
	<p>I was assigned tester for bugs or validation testing as I enjoy playing around with a new app to see if there is any problems with the app and I am able to convey the message back to the group with what bugs I discovered as well as how we could improve the app or how to fix the bug as well as seeing if I could prevent another bug from arising after fixing the first one. </p>
