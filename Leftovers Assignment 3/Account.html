	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Users are given the option to sign up with an account that allows them to save their designed layouts. With an account with FlippingRooms, users will be updated with the latest advancements our app has to offer. With secure login criteria, users will be able to decide whether to have their designs available publicly or have them private and be shared with those the user has chosen. </p>
	<p>This feature is great for people who are interested in showcasing their work to potential clients. For example, an Interior Designer is able to wipe out their work at any given moment and redecorate the ideal room for the client in real time. </p>
