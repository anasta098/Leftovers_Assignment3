	<p><b>Interest and Skills</b></p>
	<p>My interest in the IT industry has always been designing and developing. For the FlippingRooms project, I had the opportunity to design an app that allows users to remodel their homes without the need of physically moving the furniture around their home. I am interested in design because I have a keen eye for detail, and I have some experience with interior designing when I was interning in a furniture company called Felione Fine Furnishing back in Malaysia. Besides that, I have some programming skills that would help my team to build an app that we are all passionate about. I have the communication skills to work well in a team as well. </p>
	<p><b>Individually assigned roles</b></p>
	<p>I was assigned the task as an app-designer due to my experience in interior designing. While I was interning in Felione Fine Furnishing, I have always envisioned an app that could help my clients put their visions on a screen. With the course Building IT Systems, I could design an app that would just do that. My main role in this project is to design the mock-ups for FlippingRooms. I created all the mock-ups required for this application to run smoothly. I was also in charge of project documentation and further exploring the idea of our app.</p>
