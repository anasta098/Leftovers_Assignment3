	<p>We planned to test the project early by getting users involved in the project right from the designing stages. The mock-ups were a crucial part of the project as we intended to create an app that would be user friendly to all types of users. In addition to that, the layout and functionality of the app were worked out based on conducting usability testing with target users to ensure we are building the right product that meets the needs of the user. All valuable feedback, usability issues and requirements were taken into consideration to refine the prototype of the app. </p>
	<p>We performed the test using Figma and provided the link to our family and friends to test out how 'usable' our app is. Due to the time constraints, we focused on implementing all the features on Figma and solving the challenges and so, not having much time to work on the testing on the actual app. If we had the knowledge, experience and time, we would have done more testing in usability testing, integration testing, verification testing and user acceptance testing when all features are completed.</p>
